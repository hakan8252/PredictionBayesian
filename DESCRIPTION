Description: gLearn various Bayesian network models using different algorithms and data.
    These algorithms can be predefined structure learning algorithms in R
    or they can be written in R and used as input. After learning models, predictions
    of different variables could be calculated using models. Actual values and estimations
    are compared using k-fold cross validation. Prediction accuracy of models are tested
    through ROC curves and AUC values.
